# Beginner's Guide to Github Actions üèÅ

This repository contains a beginner's guide to Github Actions, designed for users who are new to the concept of automation with Github.

## What are Github Actions? üéà

Github Actions is a feature of Github that allows users to automate workflows for their repositories. This includes actions such as building and testing code, deploying applications, and more. Github Actions are defined in YAML files, which can be stored in a repository's .github/workflows directory.

## Getting Started ‚õèÔ∏è

To get started with Github Actions, follow these steps:

- Create a new repository on Github or select an existing one to work with.
- Navigate to the repository's Actions tab.
- Click on the New workflow button to create a new workflow file.
- Choose a template or start from scratch and define your workflow steps in YAML format.
- Save your changes and trigger your workflow by pushing a new commit or creating a pull request.
Workflow Syntax

The syntax for Github Actions workflows is based on YAML, a human-readable data serialization language. Here's an example of a simple workflow that triggers on pushes to the master branch:

```yaml
name: Build and Test
on:
  push:
    branches: [ master ]
jobs:
  build-and-test:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
    - name: Checkout code
      uses: actions/checkout@v2
    - name: Install dependencies
      run: npm install
    - name: Build and test code
      run: npm run build && npm test
```

In this example, the workflow is triggered by pushes to the master branch, and consists of a single job that runs on an Ubuntu environment. The job includes three steps: checking out the repository code, installing dependencies, and building and testing the code.
